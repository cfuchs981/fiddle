# Project Summary 
This is a 2D side scroller built in Java, not because that's ideal, but just out of curiousity. Also built to become more familiar with threading and the more complex capabilities of java's graphical interface. Currently there is no plot, no enemies, and no second level for the side to scroll to - BUT, that's all on the to do list. This is going to be a gradually growing project for giggles this next year. 

Controls are simple, just the arrow keys (and a amazing new and inspiring jump command with the space bar). There is an endless pit from which you can take damage, and though you can lose all your health, you cannot die. I'm not saying it's the best game in the world or even good, but it's probably not the worst? 

All art is personally created via trying to vaguely recreate some old style pixel art. I personally don't care if anything is downloaded/used/etc., but this will be updated moreso than other projects on here. 

# How to Use

Download the whole repository to your computer and run the main function in the logic directory. 

# Current To-Do in most likely order: 
1. Add several more screens 
2. Add enemies 
3. Add some way to attack enemies 
4. Make death capable 
5. Create checkpoints as map grows in size
6. Turn this into a platformer since that's likely inevitable 
7. Add NPCs
