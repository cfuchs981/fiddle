# Project Summary 
This is a 2D side scroller built in Java, mainly to become familiar with threading and the more complex capabilities of java's graphical interface. Currently there is no plot, no enemies, and no second level for the side to scroll to but the real adventure was in the coding itself (read: updates are needed and coming in the foreseeable future). 

The controls are the arrow keys (and an innovative new jump command with the space bar). You can lose all your health but not die, so this does require some suspension of disbelief. Art was created by me using reference to a multitude of old pixel-styled games. 

# How to Use

Download the whole repository to your computer and run the main function in the logic directory.
